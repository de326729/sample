        Why do most people do it? Well, they either read in a magazine
        that they should do it or was told by their trainer or therapist
        that they should do it. The reason they were told to do it might
        be because they have low back pain and supposedly the cause of their
         pain is from “tight” hip flexors. Or, they were told to do it because
         they sit all day so their hip flexors must be short and tight.
         Stretching “tight” hip flexors may give you a sensation that feels good
         or the muscles feel “tight” when stretching so it must be a good thing ,
         right? Well, maybe….or maybe not.

    <h1>Star Players Of The Tournament</h1>

  <h1>Virat Kohli</h1>
    <p>
      Born in Delhi, Virat Kohli shot into prominence as the Under-19 skipper, who led India to victory at the 2008 World Cup held in Malaysia.
      That accolade gained him instant recognition and made him an overnight teen sensation. Soon he made his ODI debut for India in Sri Lanka in August 2008 when he was thrust into the opener's role as both Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar were ruled out due to injuries.
       He played two important knocks - 37 in the second ODI and 54 in the fourth - both of which resulted in India winning.

    <h1>Aaron Finch</h1>
    <p>
      Aaron James Finch is an aggressive top-order batsman, who plays for Victoria.
       Known for his hard-hitting and ability to finish matches, Finch earned his spot in Australia's Under-19 team for the World Cup in 2006.
        Though he started out as a middle-order batsman, Finch was used as a floater and batted up the order when necessary for his club side.
        His best season came in 2009, when he impressed in the T20 Big Bash tournament.
        The season saw him scoring his maiden First-Class century when he scored 102 against Tasmania. He sealed his spot in Victoria Bushrangers' middle-order and starred in their title win.
        His performance in the season earned him a spot in the Rajasthan IPL franchise, where he got just one game.

    <h1>Yuvraj Singh</h1>
    <p>
      Amongst the cleanest hitters of a cricket ball, when Yuvraj Singh first started making waves in junior and Under-19 cricket, everyone believed that a future Indian batting star had arrived.
       His debut, when he was not yet 19, confirmed that in spectacular fashion, as he smashed an Australian attack comprising of Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie and Brett Lee to make 84 runs at better than a run-a-ball in the 2000 edition of the Champions Trophy.
       However, the wheels fell off soon after, as Yuvraj had to face accusations of a lack of commitment and focus. There were also whispers about his ability to play spin bowling.
       He didn't display his earlier form too and had to endure a spell away from the team after being dropped.

      <p class="fsize">
        Twenty20 is one of the latest forms of the cricket game, with origin that can be traced back to the late 1990s and early 2000s.
        A shortened format of cricket, meant to be played at the professional level, T20 took birth in the form of an idea, which was discussed by England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in 1998 and then again, in 2001.
         However, the idea started taking a concrete shape only in the year 2001.
          As the Benson & Hedges Cup (B&H Cup) was coming to an end, ECB felt the need for another one-day competition, as a replacement.
          <br/><br/>
      It was Stuart Robertson, the marketing manager of the ECB, who came up with the proposal for a 40-over game, with 20 overs per innings.
      He presented the concept formally in 2001, to the county chairmen. Apart from filling the space that would be emptied by culmination of B&H Cup,
       the new form of cricket also looked to be the perfect way to boost the game's popularity. It seemed to be the best option to win back the interest of the younger generation and thus,
       the declining sponsorship.
        <br/><br/>
      The 20-over innings was conceived with the aim of providing a new, stimulating form of cricket, which could hook the thousands of fans that had been put off by the longer versions.
      After the proposal of Stuart Robertson, the county voted and the votes were 11-7, 11 in favor and 7 against the new game.
      After Stuart's proposal was accepted, a media group was asked to think upon a suitable name for the game. Not much time later, Twenty20 became the name of the new cricket format, afterwards abridged as T20 cricket.

      It has been claimed that a format similar to Twenty20 was conceived by Dr George Christos, a mathematician from Perth, Western Australia. He even alleges that he presented it before the ICC and ECB in 1997. However, no credit was given to him when T20 was made public, as ICC dismissed his involvement in developing the final concept. The formal introduction of T20 Cricket took place in 2003, when ECB launched the Twenty20 Cup, along with slogan "I don't like cricket, I love it".
